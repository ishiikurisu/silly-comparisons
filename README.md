# Programming Languages Comparison

The task consisting of computing a 1600 x 900 image of the Mandelbrot fractal for each language. For each computation, a maximum of 2000 iterations should be used. The resources used for each computation should then be collected. Do this computation a 100 times and calculate the average.

It is also desired to output the image in NetBMP format so results can be compared.

Chosen programming languages:
